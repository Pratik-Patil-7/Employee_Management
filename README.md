# Employee Management System

A Java console application to manage employee information using an array. This program performs basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without a database.

## Features

- **Add Employee**: Add new employees with an ID, name, department, and salary.
- **View All Employees**: Display a list of all stored employees.
- **Update Employee**: Modify the details of an existing employee using their ID.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove an employee from the system using their ID.

## How It Works

The program uses an array to store up to 100 employee records. Each record is represented by an `Employee` object, which contains:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the employee.
- **Name**: The employee's name.
- **Department**: The department the employee belongs to.
- **Salary**: The employee's salary.

The program provides a menu-based interface for users to interact with the system.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.
